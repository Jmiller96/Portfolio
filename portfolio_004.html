 <h1>About Me:</h1>
 <h2>Emergency Medical Services:</h2>
 <p>I was a Primary Care Paramedic in Wakaw for about 5 years, during that time I was tested in what felt like every way. It showed me that I can handle high-stress situations and still perform complex tasks even in those extreme situations. Outside of those rare moments, I was responsible for playing the role of a community leader in safety and care. EMS tests many aspects of a person both professionally and personally but the one it tests the most is the ability to show compassion for a fellow human.<br><br>Every day was a new experience and I am very glad I took the time to explore this career path.</p>
 <h2>Academics:</h2>
 <p>After graduating highschool I discovered a love for learning, taking 2 courses in Anatomy and Physiology out of interest in a potential career in EMS. Being accepted to and completing the PCP (Primary Care Paramedic) program only confirmed that love. EMS has mandatory learning both in life and in the form of "Continuing Education" where you complete credit based educational programs in order to maintain your license. However, I wanted more so I continued to upgrade old highschool classes in hopes of furthering my education some day.<br><br>
 The next major academic journey was through the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, with the Information Systems Security program. As a very different type of intellectual challenge I appreciated starting at the beginning again and learning the very basics of the IT world. That quickly ended as course work became more advanced, the program had us code our own programs in C and set up small virtual networks of computers in the first semester. Which escalated to creating large/dynamic virtual environments and establishing vulnerable systems to break into using a variety of exploitation methods by the final semester, but I truly enjoyed the challenge. </p>
 <h2>Information Technology:</h2>
 <p>A few months before graduating the Information Systems Security program at SAIT I got a job with The Mosaic Company as an Access Control Specialist where I began my professional journey in IT. I have enjoyed developing my presentation and admin skills but the part I have found most interesting and worth exploring has been the work I have been able to do with the access control software, Alert Enterprise, and database, Kantech. As well as help develop the policies and procedures used in all of the Canadian mines. <br><br>
 Other tasks I have completed for the company are: developing a Security Kiosk using a variety of security software and applying it to two kinds of tablet for testing, obtaining my RPAS basic license for flying drones, general access control administration and training others to use the same system, etc.  </p>
